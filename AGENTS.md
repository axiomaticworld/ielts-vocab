## No-Stop After Completion (global hard constraint)

> Added 2026-06-03 after a real failure on `products/ielts-vocab`: the agent completed a 13-commit `git-commit-batch` cycle, then listed four "next step" options (m1 / m2 / m3 / m4) and waited for the user to pick one before doing anything, even though the user had already accepted the A merge plan earlier in the same task. The user explicitly told the agent to stop doing that. This block overrides any softer phrasing elsewhere in this workspace or in OMX templates, and it is enforced at the same level as "User-Confirmation Lockdown" above.

### Invariants (absolute)

- A completed step is **not** a hand-off moment. After a verified result, the agent MUST continue with the obvious next safe action and report at the end, unless the next action is in the explicit high-risk set below.
- Listing multiple-choice next steps at the end of a task ("choose m1/m2/m3/m4", "do you want X or Y?", "should I do A or B?") when the next safe action is already obvious is **forbidden**. Pick the default, do it, report.
- "Wait for the user to confirm" is **never** a valid terminal state for ordinary reversible local work. It is only valid for the explicit high-risk set in the next section.
- The agent owns the choreography of the next step. The user owns scope, not pacing.

### High-risk set (the ONLY cases where stopping is allowed)

Stopping to ask is allowed only for actions that match one of these categories, and the question must name the specific risk:

- Destructive / irreversible actions (`rm -rf`, force-push, dropping a DB, wiping state, deleting the only copy).
- Credential-gated actions (deploy keys, publish tokens, prod secrets, SSH private keys).
- External production actions (real users, paid services, package publish, infra apply).
- Material scope change beyond what the user stated in the current task.
- Missing authority (cannot read a file, cannot reach a service, cannot run a tool, repo permission denied).

For everything else — git commit / branch / push, file edit, install, build, test, lint, typecheck, restart a local service, run a script, generate a report, send a notification, write a doc, update memory, clean up artifacts — the agent MUST proceed and report.

### What "continue" looks like in practice

- After a batch of commits lands and is verified: pick the next obvious local action (e.g. switch to the integration branch, run a fast verification, write the summary doc, push if the task said push) and execute it. Do **not** list options.
- After a build/test/lint pass: report the result, then move to the next step in the same task. Do **not** ask "anything else?".
- After a notification is sent: log it, do not wait.
- After a long-running command finishes: read the output, decide, act.
- If a true blocker is hit, name the blocker, the minimal default plan, and the single irreversible action that would resolve it — but do not invent extra checkpoints.

### Anti-patterns (must not appear in agent output)

- "Next steps: m1 ... m2 ... m3 ... which do you want?"
- "Let me know if you'd like me to ..."
- "I can do X or Y, your call."
- "Should I continue with ..."
- "Just confirm and I'll proceed."
- "If you want, I can ..."
- A final paragraph whose only purpose is to hand the pacing decision back to the user after a clear, reversible result has already been delivered.
- "Stopping here" / "I'll wait" / "Ready when you are" after a successful step.

### Self-check before sending the final message of any task

Before sending the last message of a task, ask:

1. "Did I just list multiple-choice options at the end of a completed step?" If yes, delete the list and replace it with the next action I am about to take.
2. "Is the next action in the high-risk set above?" If no, do the next action now and report at the end of the same message.
3. "If I am about to ask a question, is the user missing information only they have, or am I asking them to re-decide something they already decided?" If the latter, delete the question.
4. "Is there a safe, reversible next step I can do in the same turn?" If yes, do it before sending.

A correct final message reads as a report + next action, never as a report + menu.


## Repo Summary
- IELTS vocabulary learning monorepo with Web, React Native mobile, shared TypeScript client core, and Flask / split-service backend surfaces.
- Main scopes: `frontend/` for the Web package; `apps/mobile/` for React Native Android/iOS; `packages/app-core/` for cross-client contracts and pure logic; `backend/` for APIs and persistence; `services/` plus `apps/gateway-bff/` for split runtime services; `vocabulary_data/` for book assets; and `docs/` for durable plans, audits, and runbooks.
- Keep future clients in `apps/*`: use `apps/miniprogram/` for a WeChat mini-program when that work starts, and only add `apps/ios/` if iOS stops sharing the React Native app.
- Runtime now treats split backend as the canonical local path: preview UI on `3002`, browser API ingress on `8000`, downstream services on `8101-8108`, and speech Socket.IO on `5001`.

## Working Agreements
- Treat repo text files as UTF-8 unless the file itself proves otherwise.
- Before using `apply_patch`, read exact target lines and anchor on stable ASCII or code structure.
- If a file shows encoding corruption, rewrite the whole logical block instead of stacking small mojibake patches.
- Keep tracked hand-edited text files at `<= 500` lines unless they are covered by the checked-in oversize baseline.
- Treat `vocabulary_data/**` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` as generated artifacts that are exempt from the `500`-line cap.
- Keep `pnpm check:file-lines` and `pnpm lint` green before submit; `pnpm build` and `pnpm test` now run the guardrail bundle automatically.
- Keep `pnpm verify:clients` green before mobile or shared-client submits.
- For Android mobile work, do not ask the user to start the simulator. Start or reuse the local AVD `ielts_vocab_api35`, start Metro on `8081`, run `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081`, install or launch the debug APK, and verify with foreground activity, `logcat`, and emulator screenshots. Only call out a gap when the emulator/SDK is broken or the scenario needs true-device coverage.
- Keep `pytest backend/tests/test_source_text_integrity.py -q` green after backend or text-heavy edits.
- Treat the remote cloud chain as canonical for domain/runtime bugs: `axiomaticworld.com -> nginx(:443/:80) -> active HTTP slot gateway-bff(:18000|:28000) -> downstream services(:18101-18108|:28101-28108)`, with `/socket.io` proxied to ASR Socket.IO on `:5001`.
- Use the local split runtime only for reproduction: preview UI on `3002`, browser API ingress on `8000`, downstream services on `8101-8108`, and speech Socket.IO on `5001`.
- When touching runtime startup, keep `start-project.sh`, `start-microservices.sh`, and `start-monolith-compat.sh` aligned with `frontend/vite.config.ts`, `nginx.conf.example`, and the real service ports.

## Current Focus
- Keep the post-Wave microservice baseline stable: normal split startup no longer exposes shared-`SQLite` override flags, service boot env loading is file-driven, tts/asr migration baselines are registered, gateway/internal auth is stricter, OSS artifact validation is green, and `scripts/repo_summary.py` is restored.
- Keep production-style local startup and proxy behavior stable after the speech-service split.
- Keep Ebbinghaus due-review, wrong-word recovery, and foundational practice modes (`smart`, `listening`, `meaning`, `dictation`, `follow`, `quickmemory`, `errors`) directly aligned with stats, learner profile, and review queue counts.
- Keep five-dimension game and AI speaking assessment as an independent advanced mode family. Do not route foundational Ebbinghaus or wrong-word recovery into `/game`.
- Continue study-center and homepage visual polish without regressing desktop/mobile layout.
- Remaining post-cutover work is now primarily operational: code-side `admin / notes / ai` boundary cleanup is in place, the table audit is clean for normal split runtime, and the main unfinished item is the final remote release/deploy/preflight/smoke/storage-drill closeout.

## Latest Sync Notes
- Post-Wave closeout advanced again: [identity_transport.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/identity_transport.py) plus [identity_admin_application.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/identity_admin_application.py) now expose an internal `set-admin` contract for `admin-ops-service`, [identity_admin_internal_client.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/identity_admin_internal_client.py), [admin_user_management_application.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/admin_user_management_application.py), and [admin_user_management_service.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/admin_user_management_service.py) now route admin toggles through that contract with legacy fallback only for compat mode, [admin_projection_repository_support.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/admin_projection_repository_support.py) now treats missing admin projection markers as a strict boundary instead of silently dropping to shared rows, [ai_context_application.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/ai_context_application.py) now returns an empty learner-profile snapshot in strict AI runtime instead of local shared-table fallback, and [service_table_plan.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/service_table_plan.py) now reports `admin-ops-service`, `notes-service`, and `ai-execution-service` with `transitional_tables: []` for the normal split-runtime audit.
- Closed Wave 5: [notes_summary_context_repository.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/notes_summary_context_repository.py) now blocks shared study-session/wrong-word fallback under strict `notes-service` runtime and only keeps that fallback for explicit legacy mode, [notes_summary_jobs_application.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/notes_summary_jobs_application.py) plus [notes_summary_job_service.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/notes_summary_job_service.py) now surface the same `503 strict-internal-contract` boundary on sync/async summary generation, and [search_cache_repository.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/search_cache_repository.py) now stores general-purpose web-search cache keys in Redis first with database fallback, which closes the last Wave 5 cache-key gap.
- Continued Wave 5 Redis-backed speech state adoption: [realtime_session_state_runtime.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/asr_runtime/realtime_session_state_runtime.py) now persists transcript-aware session snapshots into Redis with bounded `partial_transcript` / `final_transcript` excerpts, [realtime_sessions.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/asr_runtime/realtime_sessions.py) and [realtime_socketio.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/asr_runtime/realtime_socketio.py) now keep those transcript fields updated across realtime ASR events, and [socketio_service.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/asr_runtime/socketio_service.py) now exposes `/internal/sessions/<session_id>` for operator reads of the live session snapshot.
- Continued Wave 5 shared-read retirement on the `admin` HTTP surface: [admin_user_detail_repository.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/admin_user_detail_repository.py) now raises a service-boundary error instead of silently reading shared `UserBookProgress` / `UserChapterProgress` / `UserFavoriteWord` / `UserLearningEvent` rows when `learning-core-service` internal reads fail under strict split runtime, and [admin_overview_service.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/admin_overview_service.py), [admin_user_management_service.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/admin_user_management_service.py), [admin_overview_application.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/admin_overview_application.py), and [admin_user_management_application.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/admin_user_management_application.py) now surface that as explicit `503 strict-internal-contract` responses on `/api/admin/users` and `/api/admin/users/<id>`.
- Added a controlled Wave 5 projection cutover pack: [wave5_projection_cutover.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/wave5_projection_cutover.py) now runs the `admin / notes / ai` bootstrap flows and verifies marker readiness plus source/projected count parity in one place, [run-wave5-projection-cutover.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/run-wave5-projection-cutover.py) exposes it as an operator command, and a local run now passes with `admin users=2 study_sessions=578 wrong_words=1644`, `notes study_sessions=578 wrong_words=1644`, and `ai wrong_words=1644 daily_summaries=0`.
- Continued Wave 5 shared-read retirement on the `notes-service` fallback path: [learning_core_notes_context_application.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/learning_core_notes_context_application.py) plus [learning_core_transport.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/learning_core_transport.py) now expose `/internal/learning/notes-context/study-sessions` and `/internal/learning/notes-context/wrong-words`, [learning_core_notes_context_internal_client.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/learning_core_notes_context_internal_client.py) now gives `notes-service` typed snapshots for those routes, and [notes_summary_context_repository.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/notes_summary_context_repository.py) now prefers `projection -> internal` under strict split runtime and only drops to shared rows when explicit legacy fallback is enabled.
- Continued Wave 5 projection cutover hardening on the `notes` and `ai` read side: [notes_projection_bootstrap.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/notes_projection_bootstrap.py) plus [ai_projection_bootstrap.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/ai_projection_bootstrap.py) now backfill notes study-session/wrong-word and AI wrong-word/daily-summary projections while stamping service-owned cursor and bootstrap-marker rows, [bootstrap-notes-projections.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/bootstrap-notes-projections.py) plus [bootstrap-ai-projections.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/bootstrap-ai-projections.py) expose those flows as operator scripts, and [notes_summary_context_repository.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/notes_summary_context_repository.py), [ai_wrong_word_projection_support.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/ai_wrong_word_projection_support.py), and [ai_daily_summary_projection_support.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/ai_daily_summary_projection_support.py) now switch by explicit bootstrap markers instead of count parity.
- Hardened AI internal-call fallback against live local port interference: [learning_core_internal_client.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/learning_core_internal_client.py) and [catalog_content_internal_client.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/catalog_content_internal_client.py) now raise on boundary-level `401/403/404/5xx` responses so `run_with_legacy_cross_service_fallback` can still drop to the local compatibility path during local runtime and test runs.
- Continued Wave 5 `admin detail` shared-read retirement on the personalization side: [learning_core_admin_detail_application.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/learning_core_admin_detail_application.py) and [learning_core_transport.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/learning_core_transport.py) now expose `/internal/learning/admin/favorite-words`, [learning_core_admin_detail_internal_client.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/learning_core_admin_detail_internal_client.py) now owns the admin-detail learning-core client snapshots, and [admin_user_detail_repository.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/admin_user_detail_repository.py) plus the admin user-management application/service now read favorite words internal-first with shared-row fallback only when `learning-core-service` is unavailable.
- Split the old oversize admin-detail client/test files back under the `500`-line guardrail: [learning_core_internal_client.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/learning_core_internal_client.py) now keeps only the generic learning-core client surface, admin-detail snapshots moved to [learning_core_admin_detail_internal_client.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/learning_core_admin_detail_internal_client.py), and the learning-core admin-detail internal-route coverage moved into [test_internal_service_auth_admin_favorites.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/tests/test_internal_service_auth_admin_favorites.py), so `pnpm check:file-lines` is green again without adding new baseline exceptions.
- Continued Wave 5 `admin detail` shared-read retirement on the learning side: [learning_core_admin_detail_application.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/learning_core_admin_detail_application.py), [learning_core_transport.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/learning_core_transport.py), and [learning_core_internal_client.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/learning_core_internal_client.py) now expose/use narrow internal read endpoints for book progress, chapter progress, and session word-sample events, and [admin_user_detail_repository.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/admin_user_detail_repository.py) now uses those internal reads first with local shared-read fallback when `learning-core-service` is unavailable.
- Continued Wave 5 `admin` shared-read retirement on the user directory side: [admin_user_directory_repository.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/admin_user_directory_repository.py) now serves directory reads from `AdminProjectedUser` once the bootstrap marker is present while still keeping owner writes on shared `User`, [auth_repository.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/auth_repository.py) and `set-admin` now refresh the projected user snapshot on write, and [test_wave5_identity_admin_event_flow.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/tests/test_wave5_identity_admin_event_flow.py) now locks projection-first directory reads plus projection refresh on profile/admin updates.
- Tightened the Wave 5 `admin` projection cutover contract: [admin_projection_repository_support.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/admin_projection_repository_support.py) now switches user/session/wrong-word read models by explicit bootstrap marker cursors instead of comparing projection row counts against shared tables, and the related Wave 5 tests now lock that marker-driven behavior.
- Added a safe Wave 5 admin projection bootstrap path: [admin_projection_bootstrap.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/admin_projection_bootstrap.py) now backfills `AdminProjectedUser`, `AdminProjectedStudySession`, and `AdminProjectedWrongWord` from current shared tables while stamping the related `AdminProjectionCursor` rows, [bootstrap-admin-projections.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/bootstrap-admin-projections.py) exposes that flow as an operator script, and [test_admin_projection_bootstrap.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/tests/test_admin_projection_bootstrap.py) locks the backfill plus idempotent refresh contract.
- Added the first Redis-backed ASR ephemeral-state slice: [realtime_session_state_runtime.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/asr_runtime/realtime_session_state_runtime.py) now mirrors realtime session metadata into Redis with TTL-backed snapshots and active-session counting, [realtime_socketio.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/asr_runtime/realtime_socketio.py) and [realtime_sessions.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/asr_runtime/realtime_sessions.py) now sync that state across session lifecycle transitions, and [test_asr_realtime_session_state_runtime.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/tests/test_asr_realtime_session_state_runtime.py) locks the Redis snapshot contract.
- Landed the first real Redis-backed Wave 5 workload: [identity_rate_limit_runtime.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/packages/platform-sdk/platform_sdk/identity_rate_limit_runtime.py) now drives auth/email throttling through `Redis-first` counters with database fallback, [auth_repository.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/services/auth_repository.py) now routes login, bind-email code, and forgot-password checks through that path, and [test_auth_rate_limiting.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/tests/test_auth_rate_limiting.py) now locks both Redis and DB-fallback behavior.
- Promoted the Wave 5 worker-aware deploy contract into the normal release path: [run-service.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/run-service.sh), [release-common.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/release-common.sh), and [smoke-check.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/smoke-check.sh) are no longer waiting on a future rollout step, and the remaining Wave 5 closure work is broader shared-read retirement plus Redis-backed workload adoption.
- Added deploy-time split-service schema migration support in [deploy-release.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/deploy-release.sh) and [run-service-schema-migrations.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/run-service-schema-migrations.py), then decoupled the migration runner from app secrets so deploy bootstraps can run before service-specific secret material is loaded.
- Preserved frontend auth sessions across deploy restarts by tightening [AuthContext.tsx](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx) and the shared storage helpers in [index.ts](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/frontend/src/lib/index.ts), with regression coverage in [AuthContext.test.tsx](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.test.tsx) and [index.test.ts](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/frontend/src/lib/index.test.ts).
- Added the Wave 5 remote worker deploy contract: [run-service.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/run-service.sh) now routes all outbox/projection workers through `ielts-service@<worker>`, [release-common.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/release-common.sh) now enables workers only when the target release supports them and disables them on rollback to older releases, and [smoke-check.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/smoke-check.sh) now verifies worker systemd activity when the current release has worker support.
- Executed the Wave 5 remote broker rollout on `119.29.182.134`: `/etc/ielts-vocab/microservices.env` now carries the Redis/RabbitMQ baseline, `redis` plus `rabbitmq-server` are installed and active, and the new broker validation, preflight, and smoke chain all passed remotely against the deployed host.
- Fixed a first-install bug in [provision-broker-runtime.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/provision-broker-runtime.sh): the script now installs broker packages before requiring `redis-cli`, `rabbitmqctl`, and `rabbitmq-diagnostics`, so a clean remote host can bootstrap successfully.
- Added the Wave 5 remote broker rollout baseline: [provision-postgres.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/provision-postgres.sh) now writes canonical `REDIS_*` plus `RABBITMQ_*` settings into `/etc/ielts-vocab/microservices.env`, [install-cloud-runtime.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/install-cloud-runtime.sh) now installs and enables `redis` plus `rabbitmq-server`, [provision-broker-runtime.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/provision-broker-runtime.sh) now provisions the remote local-host broker baseline, and [validate-broker-runtime.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/validate-broker-runtime.sh) is now wired into remote validation.
- Tightened Wave 5 broker validation so missing broker env no longer hides behind code defaults: [validate_wave5_broker_runtime.py](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/validate_wave5_broker_runtime.py) now requires explicit broker settings, [backend/.env.microservices.local](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/backend/.env.microservices.local) now carries the local Redis/RabbitMQ baseline, and remote [preflight-check.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/preflight-check.sh) plus [smoke-check.sh](/Volumes/code/workspace/products/ielts-vocab/scripts/cloud-deploy/smoke-check.sh) now validate broker env, systemd units, and runtime connectivity before the HTTP smoke path.
- Closed the code-side Wave 4 storage/artifact parity tooling: shared-`SQLite` scoped-override restart records, remote storage drill plus rollback evidence flow, and `notes export`, `example-audio`, plus `word-audio` `OSS` validate/repair operators are now all documented and wired into the remote runbook.
- Added a Wave 5 `notes-service <- learning.wrong_word.updated` consumer path: `notes_projected_wrong_words` now materializes wrong-word facts from events, `start-microservices.sh` now boots the grouped `notes-domain-worker`, and `notes_summary_context_repository` now prefers that projection once per-user state catches up.
- Added a Wave 5 `ai-execution-service <- notes.summary.generated` consumer path: `ai_projected_daily_summaries` now materializes notes summary facts from events, `start-microservices.sh` now boots the grouped `ai-execution-domain-worker`, `/internal/notes/summaries` is available for service-auth reads, and AI context now falls back to projected summaries when `notes-service` is unavailable.
- Added a Wave 5 `ai-execution-service <- learning.wrong_word.updated` consumer path: `ai_projected_wrong_words` now materializes wrong-word facts from events, `start-microservices.sh` now boots the grouped `ai-execution-domain-worker`, and AI wrong-word reads plus the `get_wrong_words` tool now fall back to that projection when `learning-core-service` is unavailable.
- Added a Wave 5 `notes-service <- ai.prompt_run.completed` consumer path: `notes_projected_prompt_runs` now materializes AI prompt-run facts from events, notes summary generation reads that projection into a new `当天 AI 使用痕迹` section, and `start-microservices.sh` now boots the grouped `notes-domain-worker`.
- Added a Wave 5 `notes-service <- learning.session.logged` consumer path: `notes_projected_study_sessions` now materializes study-session context from events, `notes_summary_context_repository` prefers that projection once it catches up, and `start-microservices.sh` now boots the grouped `notes-domain-worker`.
- Added Wave 5 `tts.media.generated` and `ai.prompt_run.completed` end-to-end local event flows with service-owned materialization tables, real outbox publisher workers, and admin projection workers, and exposed recent prompt-run plus TTS-media metrics in admin overview.
- `start-microservices.sh` now boots the canonical grouped worker set: `core-eventing-worker`, `notes-domain-worker`, `ai-execution-domain-worker`, and `admin-ops-domain-worker`.
- Split speech handling out of the main Flask app into `backend/speech_service.py` on port `5001`, and updated proxy/startup flow accordingly.
- Added quick-memory reconciliation before learning-stats fetches so newer local records reach the backend before dashboard reads.
- Fixed the due-review timezone skew that undercounted recently due words in `learning-stats` and `learner-profile`.

## Encoding & Patch Strategy
- Assume repo text files are UTF-8 unless the file itself proves otherwise.
- Before using `apply_patch`, read the exact target lines with line numbers and anchor on nearby clean ASCII or stable code structure.
- Prefer patching whole logical blocks over matching a single suspicious line when a file shows any text corruption.
- If `apply_patch` fails to match twice on the same area, stop matching the mojibake literally. Re-anchor on clean surrounding code, or rewrite the full function/component/doc block instead.
- Do not keep stacking partial edits onto a file that shows encoding corruption. Restore or re-read a clean base first, then replay the intended change.
- After any encoding-related fix, inspect the diff and confirm the file did not pick up unrelated text corruption.
- Keep the text-integrity regression green: `pytest backend/tests/test_source_text_integrity.py -q`.

## File Line Guardrail
- The hard cap is `500` lines for tracked hand-edited text files across app code, backend code, tests, scripts, docs, and config.
- `vocabulary_data/**` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` are explicitly exempt because they are generated data or lockfiles.
- Historical oversize files are frozen in `scripts/file-line-limit.config.json`. They are temporary exceptions, may not grow past their recorded baseline, and should be split down over time.
- `scripts/check-file-line-limits.mjs` is the enforcement gate. It fails when a new oversize file appears, when a baseline file grows, or when the baseline file is not cleaned up after a file drops back to `<= 500` lines.
- `frontend/eslint.config.mjs` mirrors the `500`-line cap for tracked JS/TS files, while letting the oversize baseline remain temporarily exempt until those files are split.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs both the file-line script and ESLint explicitly before frontend tests/build so the rule is enforced in CI, not just locally.

## Technology Stack
- Web: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- Mobile: React Native under `apps/mobile`, with Android and iOS owned by the same app unless a future native split is explicitly chosen
- Shared client core: `packages/app-core` for platform-neutral schemas, API clients, auth/session contracts, and practice logic
- Styling: SCSS + CSS variables
- Validation: Zod runtime schemas in `frontend/src/lib/schemas.ts`
- Backend: Python Flask + SQLite
- Auth: JWT + localStorage
- Realtime: Socket.IO / WebSocket for speech

## Zod Validation
- Schema location: `frontend/src/lib/schemas.ts`
- Validation utilities: `frontend/src/lib/validation.ts`
- Form hook: `frontend/src/lib/useForm.ts`
- Auth, settings, toast, AI chat, and vocabulary hooks all validate inputs or API payloads through Zod-backed helpers.

## Key Features
1. Authentication and user profile management
2. Vocabulary books, chapters, and progress tracking
3. Foundational practice modes: `smart`, `listening`, `meaning`, `dictation`, `follow`, `radio`, `quickmemory`, `errors`
4. Ebbinghaus due review and wrong-word recovery linked directly to statistics and learner profile
5. Independent advanced five-dimension / AI speaking mode family for paid or 2.0 rollout
6. Guided study homepage and learner-profile driven recommendations
7. AI assistant, journal, and daily summary flows
8. Dedicated speech recognition service and TTS tooling

## Backend API
- `/api/auth`: register, login, logout, avatar, current user
- `/api/books`: books, chapters, words, progress
- `/api/progress`: legacy day-based progress
- `/api/ai`: learning stats, learner profile, quick memory, AI assistant, practice helpers
- `/api/notes`: notes, summaries, exports
- `/api/tts`: TTS audio and generation state
- `/api/admin`: admin capabilities

## Development
```bash
# Frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm preview
pnpm test:e2e

# Mobile and shared client core
pnpm mobile:typecheck
pnpm mobile:test
pnpm app-core:typecheck
pnpm app-core:test
pnpm verify:clients

# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Canonical split backend startup
./start-microservices.sh

# Monolith compatibility rollback drill
./start-monolith-compat.sh

# One-click local production-style startup
./start-project.sh
```

## Test Account
- Dedicated test account for local/manual verification: username `admin`
- Password: `admin123456`

## Production SSH Access
- Production SSH connection metadata is already tracked in `backend/.env`; when Codex needs remote access, read `PROD_SSH_HOST`, `PROD_SSH_USER`, and `PROD_SSH_KEY_PATH` or `PROD_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` from that file first instead of assuming the local shell has no credentials.
- Treat `backend/.env` as sensitive: use it to resolve the SSH host, username, and local key-file path, but never echo private-key contents or unrelated secrets back to the user.
- Preferred PowerShell discovery snippet:
```powershell
$envPath = 'backend/.env'
$sshKey = (Get-Content $envPath | Where-Object { $_ -match '^PROD_SSH_(PRIVATE_)?KEY_PATH=' } | Select-Object -First 1).Split('=', 2)[1].Trim()
$remoteHost = (Get-Content $envPath | Where-Object { $_ -match '^PROD_SSH_HOST=' } | Select-Object -First 1).Split('=', 2)[1].Trim()
$remoteUser = (Get-Content $envPath | Where-Object { $_ -match '^PROD_SSH_USER=' } | Select-Object -First 1).Split('=', 2)[1].Trim()
ssh -i $sshKey -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new "$remoteUser@$remoteHost" "hostname"
```
- Preferred production log commands after connecting:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u 'ielts-service@gateway-bff' -u 'ielts-service@learning-core-service' -u 'ielts-service@ai-execution-service' -n 200 --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u 'ielts-service@catalog-content-service' -n 200 --no-pager
```
- When a browser request fails only for logged-in users, inspect `gateway-bff`, `learning-core-service`, `ai-execution-service`, and `catalog-content-service` together before assuming the frontend auth flow is at fault.

## Remote Production Topology
1. `https://axiomaticworld.com/` terminates at the cloud nginx entrypoint on `119.29.182.134`
2. nginx serves the frontend build from the active release symlink under `/var/www/ielts-vocab/current`
3. nginx proxies `/api/*` to the active HTTP slot `gateway-bff` on `127.0.0.1:18000` or `127.0.0.1:28000`
4. `gateway-bff` fans out browser API traffic to the same-slot microservices on `18101-18108` or `28101-28108`
5. nginx proxies `/socket.io/*` directly to ASR Socket.IO on `127.0.0.1:5001`

When debugging domain issues, treat this remote chain as the deployment context instead of assuming any local tunnel is involved.

## Local Reproduction Topology
1. Vite preview serves the browser UI on `http://127.0.0.1:3002`
2. Local browser API ingress runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
3. Split backend services run on `127.0.0.1:8101-8108`
4. Local `/socket.io/*` traffic goes to ASR Socket.IO on `127.0.0.1:5001`

## Browser APIs
- `speechSynthesis`: pronunciation playback
- `localStorage`: auth, settings, progress, quick-memory caches
- `WebSocket` / Socket.IO: realtime speech recognition
