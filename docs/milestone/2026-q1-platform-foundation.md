# 2026 Q1 Platform Foundation

## Summary

The project crossed from a set of mostly finished pages into a more connected learning platform foundation.

## Delivered

### AI assistant improvements

- Added fullscreen and restore behavior for the assistant panel.
- Improved assistant message rendering and markdown presentation.
- Made greeting behavior more profile-aware instead of defaulting to generic option prompts.

### Learning memory and profile integration

- Connected related-history memory into AI prompting.
- Fed repeated confusion topics and weak-focus words into learner profile handling.
- Surfaced profile and memory signals in journal and summary flows.

### Practice intelligence improvements

- Prioritized weak-focus and wrong-word targeting in practice generation.
- Started unifying practice behavior around a learner-profile model instead of isolated page logic.

### Documentation and repository hygiene

- Added repository-wide text integrity checks for source and docs files.
- Normalized editing guidance for patching and encoding-sensitive work.
- Reorganized `docs/` into architecture, governance, operations, planning, milestone, and logs.

## Why It Matters

These changes moved the product away from isolated feature pages and toward a shared learning context across AI chat, journal, summaries, and practice.

- Keep refining cross-mode question generation around weak points and confusion patterns.
- Continue tightening the docs architecture as more plans and specs accumulate.
