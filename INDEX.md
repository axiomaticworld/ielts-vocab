- `models.py` / `model_definitions/` — data models
- `routes/` — HTTP / Socket.IO route layer
- `services/` — service / repository / provider adapter layer
- `tests/` — backend tests
- `README.md` — backend architecture and layering
- `API.md` — API index

## Apps and packages

- `reference-materials/raw/` — IELTS PDFs and audio (git-ignored, kept locally)

## Scripts and runtime

- `scripts/` — guard scripts, repo utilities, commit-batch helpers

## Source-of-truth resolution order

1. `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` for entrypoint narrative.
2. `PRD.md` for product scope; `TDD.md` for technical design and verification.
3. `AGENTS.md` for agent rules and edit boundaries.
4. `MILESTONE.md` for current status; `MILESTONE.md` for historical Wave detail.
5. `TODO.md` for active work; `CHANGELOG.md` for shipped history.
6. `docs/architecture/*` for deep design; `docs/operations/*` for run/ops; `docs/governance/*` for policy.

## Update discipline

- Update `INDEX.md` whenever a new top-level document is added or its owner changes.
- Update `project-docs.manifest.json` alongside `INDEX.md` so machine-readable consumers stay aligned.
- Every material change in this index should be reflected in `CHANGELOG.md` if the change is user-visible.
